    Depending on the tld of the domain being updated a request can be successful
    and completed synchronously. This will return a 200 response and the body of
    the resource. 


    A request can also be accepted and be processed asynchronously, This will
    return a 202 and the body of the resource. 


    Lastly updating a contact can require more actions. In this case the request
    is also accepted with a 202 response code but the response will contain a
    human readable message and a link to a ticket which can be opened inside the
    customer portal.
