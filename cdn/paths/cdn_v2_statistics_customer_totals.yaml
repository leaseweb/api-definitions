  summary: Get Total Statistics For Customer
  description: >-
    Query total statistics for customer

    This endpoint is intended to be used for getting the summed (total)
    statistics from the reporting backend


    It currently supports DATATRANSFER, BANDWIDTH, REQUESTS, STATUS_2XX,
    STATUS_4XX, STATUS_5XX, CACHEHIT and 95TH as a metric.

        DATATRANSFER: used to get the consumed amount of traffic (in bytes) in the queried period.
        BANDWIDTH: used to get the mean amount of bits per second in the queried period.
        STATUS_2XX/4XX/5XX: used to get a percentage of the amount of response codes in the queried period.
        CACHEHIT: used to get the mean cache-hit ratio in the queried period.
        REQUESTS: used to get the total amount of serviced requests in the queried period.
        95TH: used to get the 95th percentile in bits per second for the queried period.

    The fromDt and toDt must use the format YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss eg..
    2024-07-14T13:40:00.


    Using the 'groupBy' parameter will allow you to group results together.
    Supported groupings are PROVIDER, DISTRIBUTION, CUSTOMER and REGION.

    By specifying the distributionId as an additional filter the query will run
    just for the specified distribution.
